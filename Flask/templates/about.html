Welcome to our About page! This small project was set up as part of out Interasctive Systems (H) course by the //TODO team. This project is a web application to be used by runners. The users are given the option to choose an existing route to follow for their run or upload a new route. In order to upload a new one they will need to create a gpx file while they run and then this will be uploaded to the database where all routes are found.</p>

Enjoy! </p>
